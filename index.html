								<center><header><h2>About Me</h2></header></center>
							
								<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/">David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </a> and the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/">Dunlap Institute for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</a> at the University of Toronto. I received my HBSc degree in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Toronto in 2016. I have worked on several areas of observational astrophysics including early low- and high-mass star formation, astrochemistry, interstellar extinction, and Galactic magnetism. For my PhD thesis, I am grateful to be working under the co-supervision of <a href="http://dunlap.utoronto.ca/~bgaensler/">Bryan Gaensler</a> and <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~seclark/">Susan Clark</a> to improve our understanding of the multi-phase Galactic magnetic field. I am also working with <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/">Peter Martin</a> on using deeply embedded massive stars to characterize the interstellar extinction curve towards regions of high-mass star formation. To learn more about my research, click <strong><a href="research.html">here</a></strong>.</p>
								
								<p>In addition to research in astrophysics, I have been actively involved in promoting a supportive and inclusive work environment. I am currently a member of the PRISM (People Representing Intersectional Spectral Minorities) which is a graduate-led group that seeks to provide space and advocacy for LGBTQIA+ folk while educating the Department on queer issues. Most recently, I was involved in facilitating a conversation among graduate students on the ongoing issues surrounding the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope in Maunakea in an effort to ensure that the graduate voice is heard by our Department leadership. As a member of the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/about/diversity-equity/">Dunlap Diversity Committee</a>, I have contributed to organizing DiversiTea workshops covering topics such as imposter syndrome, graduate mental health, stress management, and LGBTQIA+ inclusivity. I am also one of three co-authors of the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/about/values-statement/">Dunlap Code of Conduct</a>, and was a serving member of the Values Statement Committee which implemented a <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/about/values-statement/">Values Statement</a> for the Dunlap Institute, David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, and Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.` </p>

								<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/ras/GALFACTS">GALFACTS</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/galfahi/">GALFA-HI</a>, and GMIMS collaborations. </p>

						<p>I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land. </p>
