								<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/">David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </a> and the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/">Dunlap Institute for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</a> at the University of Toronto. I received my HBSc degree in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Toronto in 2016, where I did my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/">Peter Martin</a>. I have worked on several areas of observational astrophysics including early low- and high-mass star formation, astrochemistry, interstellar extinction, and Galactic magnetism. My PhD thesis is focused on understanding how Galactic magnetic fields are coupled between different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and is under the co-supervision of <a href="http://dunlap.utoronto.ca/~bgaensler/">Bryan Gaensler</a> and <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~seclark/">Susan Clark</a>. I also continue to work with Peter Martin on using deeply embedded massive stars to characterize the interstellar extinction curve towards regions of high-mass star formation. To learn more about my research, click <strong><a href="research.html">here</a></strong>.</p>
								
								<p>In addition to my research, I have been actively involved in advancing diversity and inclusion as well as creating a more supportive work environment. As a member of the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/about/diversity-equity/">Dunlap Diversity Committee</a>, I helped organize DiversiTea workshops covering topics such as imposter syndrome, graduate mental health, stress management, and LGBTQIA+ inclusivity. I am also one of three co-authors of the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/about/values-statement/">Dunlap Code of Conduct</a>, and was a serving member of the Values Statement Committee which implemented a <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/about/values-statement/">Values Statement</a> for the three astronomy units at the University of Toronto. As a member of PRISM (People Representing Intersectional Spectral Minorities) I helped to spread awareness of the LGBTQIA+ community, advocate for safer spaces, and foster a community for queer astronomers. I was also involved in facilitating a conversation among graduate students on the ongoing issues surrounding the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) in Maunakea and ensuring that the graduate voice was heard by our Department leadership. </p>

								<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/ras/GALFACTS">GALFACTS</a> and GMIMS collaborations. </p>

						<p>I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and I am grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land. </p>
