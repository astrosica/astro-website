					<p>My primary research interest lies in our Galaxy's complex interstellar medium (ISM). Currently, my PhD thesis work focuses on using magnetic tracers in different phases of the ISM to see how the Milky Way's magnetic field is threaded between these different components. In the past, I have also worked on Galactic radio continuum loops and bubbles, early low- and high-mass star formation, interstellar dust extinction, and astrochemistry. As a result, I have experience using observational data from a variety of radio, infrared, and optical telescopes: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Arecibo, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), Parkes Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Telescope, Planck Space Telescope, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Green Bank Telescope (GBT), Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), Isac Newton Telescope (INT), and Dunlap Institute Telescope (DIT). </p>

							<p><br>Our Galaxy contains a complex arrangement of interstellar media that is magnetized and highly turbulent. Spatial gradients of radio polarization images show an intricate arrangement of filaments in the ionized medium interpreted as being the result of abrupt changes in the line-of-sight magnetic field strength and/or thermal electron density. Pictured (left) is a radio polarization gradient map towards a bright polarized filament using Arecibo data. This data is filled with scanning artefacts which I have removed for a much clearer view. The recent discovery of high-latitude magnetically-aligned fibers in the CNM (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789...82C">Clark et al., 2014</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhRvL.115x1302C">2015</a>) suggests that even regions of extremely low ionization fraction are dynamically driven by magnetic fields. While polarization gradient studies are helping to uncover the magnetic properties of the ionized medium, the role that our Galaxy's magnetic field plays in the structure and formation of the cold neutral medium (CNM) remains poorly understood. To help answer this question, I am currently working on using radio polarization and 21 cm HI observations to investigate how our Galaxy's magnetic field is threaded between these two very different components of the interstellar medium.

							<p><br><br>As my first introduction to Galactic magnetism, I began working under the supervision of <a href="http://dunlap.utoronto.ca/~bgaensler/">Bryan Gaensler</a> to characterize the magnetic field properties of Galactic-scale filaments, loops, and bubbles in the Milky Way Galaxy. Such structures are some of the largest features in the Galactic sky and while they were discovered in the 60's, their origin still remains unknown. Pictured (left) is a schematic that depicts how triggers such as SNe and stellar winds can cause overdensities in the circumstellar media (grey) and compress associated magnetic field lines (red) which are seen as increased field strengths. To attempt to address the nature of these structures, I performed a multi-frequency analysis using a variety of continuum, polarization, and spectral data from surveys including the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS), Continuum HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (CHIPASS), HI 4-pi (HI4PI), and Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM). Obtaining estimates of their parallel magnetic field strengths, ionization fractions, and compression factors allowed me to make statements on what objects are likely to be triggering these features. </p>

								The Interstellar Extinction Curve of the Massive Star-Forming W3 GMC (Campbell et al., 2019 in prep.)

							<p><br>I'm also working with <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/">Peter Martin</a> on interstellar extinction in massive star forming regions using an assortment of optical and infrared photometry of the W3 giant molecular cloud. By characterizing the way in which dust particles absorb and scatter interstellar light, and how this so-called extinction changes as a function of frequency, we can obtain the interstellar extinction curve of the dust. While the extinction curve is not very well understood even for the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) where the gas is mostly atomic, studies of massive star forming regions where the ISM is mostly molecular is significantly lacking. Since extinction causes stars to appear more red than they really are, the challenge in obtaining the extinction curve is potential confusion from intrinsically red objects (e.g., pre-main sequence stars, red giants etc.) which will appear red even without extinction. To avoid such a degeneracy, we are targeting massive OB stars whose intrinsic colours are well known and not red. Pictured (left) is sample spectral energy distribution (SED) for a B0.5-B2V star overlaid with the CCM extinction model for the galactic average (dashed red) and the typical molecular ISM (solid red). This particular star is well modelled using CCM extinction above 50 microns, however it appears to exhibit an infrared excess in the Spitzer bands which may be from free-free emission from an ionized circumstellar disk which cannot be modelled using extinction. </p>

							<p>My first undergraduate research project, supervised by <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfriesen/">Rachel Friesen</a> and <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/">Peter Martin</a>, introduced me to an area of research that I maintain a strong interest in to this day: astrochemistry and star formation. Low mass stars like our Sun form in dense cores within molecular clouds, but the details of how these pre-stellar objects evolve to their stellar counterparts remains unknown. For this project I worked on a JCMT molecular line survey of dense cores in the Perseus molecular cloud to search for signatures of core infall and related these infall signatures to core characteristics to study the details of their collapse. Our analysis was primarily focused on the relationship between line asymmetries in optically thick molecular species and core infall velocities, as well as tracers of core evolution like the cores' Jeans mass, virial mass, and non-thermal linewidths. The figure to the left shows the cores' ratio of mass to Jeans mass (left) and  non-thermal linewidths (right) as a function of their modelled infall velocities. The results of this project led to my first first-authored published paper as well as my first conference poster presentation, both of which can be accessed with the links below.</p>

								Constructing Python Software to Analyze Spatially Resolved ALMA Spectroscopy of IRAS 16293-2422

							<p><br><br>During my second last year of undergraduate studies, I visited Leiden University in the Netherlands to attend the Leiden/ESA Astrophysics Program for Summer Students (LEAPS). I worked with <a href="https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/people/mihkel.kama">Mihkel Kama</a> and <a href="http://vilhelm.nu/">Magnus Persson</a> for two and a half months on characterizing the astrophysical conditions of the popular chemically-rich hot corino IRAS 16293-2422 using spatially resolved, high spectral resolution data cubes obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). While ALMA's capabilities provide significant advantages for molecular spectroscopy of chemically-rich objects, analyzing such complex high-quality data proves to be very challenging, so I wrote Python software capable of analyzing such data. The <a href="http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL Molecular Spectroscopy database</a> and the <a href="https://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms">Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy</a> were first queried to search for molecular rotational transitions in the observed frequency ranges. Molecular detections were then used to created moment maps (intensity, velocity, and velocity dispersion) for each rotational transition and the population diagram technique was used to determine the total column density of each of the detected molecular species. Imaged (left) is a set of such maps for one of the many detections; these are a) intensity, b) velocity, c) velocity dispersion, and d) total column density. This project greatly challenged my programming skills, and improved my knowledge of the impact that star formation has on the surrounding interstellar medium as well as the challenges that lie in high resolution spectroscopy. </p>

								Using High-Resolution JCMT Images to Complement Herschel in Regions of Massive Star Formation

							<p>I completed my undergraduate thesis with <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/">Peter Martin</a> where I investigated the effects of Herschel's angular resolution degradation on compact sources in massive star forming regions. Compact sources in GMCs, which may form an entire cluster of stars, are often extended with poorly constrained sizes. The result is that Herschel measures increasingly larger masses as its beam size increases from its 70 to 500 um passbands. Additionally, these are regions where the Galactic cirrus is complex and can introduce contamination, which is even more complicated by the high degree of clustering typical in GMCs. For this project, I used high-resolution JCMT images of the W3 GMC to quantify these effects. Since JCMT's 450 um passband is similiar in wavelength to Herschel's 500 um passband, it could be used to directly measure this problem of contamination. To do this, I convolved and regridded the JCMT 450 um map to the resolution of Herschel at 500 um. I then measured flux densities of an assortment of compact sources in the degraded JCMT 450 um map and directly compared these measurements to those from the native JCMT 450 um map to quantify the level of contamination due to Herschel's beam smearing. The figure to the left shows one such compact source in multiple resolution maps. </p>

							<p><br><br>My second research project, supervised by Dr. Brian Cherinka, entailed searching for candidate Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) systems by measuring neutral hydrogen (HI) column densities in local galaxies. DLA systems trace the largest resevoirs of HI in the universe and are observed as HI absorption in background quasar spectra caused by atomic hydrogen foreground galaxies. It was originally thought that DLAs were signatures of luminous disk galaxies, but the inability to directly detect DLA systems began to point towards low surface brightness or dwarf galaxies. Additionally, 21 cm observations of neutral hydrogen in luminous disk galaxies suggested that they had sufficient column densities to be DLA candidates yet they appeared to be missing from the DLA population. To investigate this discrepancy, I worked with 21 cm GBT observations of six local galaxy-quasar pairs to search for neutral hydrogen absorption to determine if they were candidate DLAs based on their hydrogen column densities. Unfortunately the radio frequency interference (RFI) in the data were far too strong to be able to preserve enough of the data to observe any detections. </p>
