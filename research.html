				<p>My primary research interest lies in understanding our Galaxy's complex multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). Currently, my PhD thesis focuses on using magnetic field tracers in different phases of the ISM to improve our understanding of the Galactic magnetic field. In the past, I have also worked on Galactic radio loops and bubbles, early low- and high-mass star formation, interstellar dust extinction, and astrochemistry. As a result, I have experience using observational data from a variety of radio, infrared, and optical telescopes such as Arecibo, JCMT, DRAO, ALMA, Parkes, Planck, and GBT.</p>

				<p>The ISM in our Galaxy is multi-phase and magnetized. However, magnetic field tracers probe different Galactic volumes and components of the magnetic field vector, making it a considerable challenge to understand how the Galactic magnetic field threads this multi-phase medium. Spatial gradients of the radio polarization vector reveal a network of filamentary structures caused by turbulence-driven dicontinuities in the line-of-sight magnetic field strength and/or thermal electron density (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.478..214G">Gaensler et al. 2011</a>) primarily in the warm ionized medium (WIM). On the other hand, linear HI structures in narrow velocity channels are density structures dominated by the cold neutral medium (CNM) that highlight the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789...82C">Clark et al. 2014</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhRvL.115x1302C">2015</a>). Uing 1.4 GHz GALFACTS continuum polarization and GALFA-HI line emission data commensally observed with Arecibo, we compared structures in the polarization gradient to HI emission. In the high-Galactic latitude Arecibo sky, we found one region that contains filaments in the polarization gradient that are strongly aligned with HI structures, suggesting that the warm ionized and cold neutral gas share a common magnetic field in this region.</p>

				<p>Dust grains in the ISM scatter and absorb background starlight, causing stars to appear more red than they actually are. By characterizing this effect of interstellar extinction as a function of frequency, we can obtain the interstellar extinction curve. The extinction curve is not well understood even for the diffuse ISM where the gas is mostly atomic, and extinction studies of massive star forming regions where the ISM is mostly molecular is significantly lacking. Because it is difficult to decouple extinction from intrinsically red objects (e.g., pre-main sequence stars, red giants), we are targeting massive OB stars whose intrinsic colours are well known (and not red) to characterize the extinction curve in the W3 giant molecular cloud using an assortment of optical and infrared photometry. This includes photometry from the Dunlap Institute Telescope that I have reduced and calibrated.</p>

				<p><br>As my first introduction to Galactic magnetism, I worked under the supervision of Bryan Gaensler to characterize the magnetic field properties of Galactic-scale filaments, loops, and bubbles in our Galaxy. Such structures are some of the largest features in the Galactic sky and while they were discovered in the 60's, their origin still remains unclear. Pictured (left) is a schematic that depicts how triggers such as SNe and stellar winds can cause overdensities in the circumstellar media (grey) and compress associated magnetic field lines (red) which are seen as increased field strengths. To attempt to address the nature of these structures, I performed a multi-frequency analysis using a variety of continuum, polarization, and spectral data from surveys including the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS), Continuum HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (CHIPASS), HI 4-pi (HI4PI), and Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM).</p>

				<p>My first undergraduate research project was supervised by Rachel Friesen and Peter Martin on low-mass star formation. Low mass stars like our Sun form in dense cores within molecular clouds, but the details of how these pre-stellar objects evolve to their stellar counterparts remains unclear. I worked on a JCMT molecular line survey of pre-stellar dense cores in the Perseus molecular cloud to search for signatures of core infall and related their infall signatures to tracers of core evolution (e.g., Jeans mass, virial mass, non-thermal linewidth). The figure (left) shows the cores' ratio of mass to Jeans mass (left) and non-thermal linewidths (right) as a function of their infall velocities. The results of this project led to my first first-authored paper as well as my first conference poster presentation, both of which can be accessed via the links below.</p>

				<p>During my second last year of undergraduate studies, I visited Leiden University in the Netherlands to attend the Leiden/ESA Astrophysics Program for Summer Students (LEAPS). I worked with Mihkel Kama and Magnus Persson on characterizing the astrophysical conditions of the popular chemically-rich hot corino IRAS 16293-2422 using spatially resolved, high spectral resolution data cubes obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). While ALMA's capabilities provide significant advantages for molecular spectroscopy of chemically-rich objects, analyzing such complex high-quality data proves to be very challenging, so I wrote Python software capable of analyzing such data. The software I wrote was used to created moment maps (intensity, velocity, and velocity dispersion) fand the population diagram technique was used to determine the total column density of each of the detected molecular species. Imaged (left) is a set of such maps for one of the many detections; these are a) intensity, b) velocity, c) velocity dispersion, and d) total column density. This project greatly challenged my programming skills, and improved my knowledge of the impact that star formation has on the surrounding interstellar medium as well as the challenges that lie in high resolution spectroscopy.</p>

				<p>Under the supervision of Peter Martin, I completed my undergraduate thesis on the effects of Herschel's angular resolution degradation on compact sources in regions of massive star formation. Compact sources in giant molecular clouds, which may form an entire cluster of stars, are often extended, superimposed on a fluctuating background, and often crowded. The result is that Herschel measures increasingly larger masses as its beam size increases from 70 to 500 micrometers. Additionally, the Galactic cirrus, which can introduce contamination, is further complicated by the high degree of clustering typical in these environments. For this project, I used high-resolution JCMT images of W3 to quantify these effects. Since JCMT's 450 micron passband is similiar in wavelength to Herschel's 500 micron passband, it can be used to directly measure this problem of contamination. The figure (left) shows one such compact source.</p>
