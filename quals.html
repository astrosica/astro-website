						<h2>General Qualifying Exam</h2>
						<p>cosmology ; extragalactic astronomy ; galactic astronomy ; stellar astrophysics ; physics </p>
					</header>
					<p> The General Qualifying Exam is an oral examination to a panel of faculty members typically taking place in the summer of second year. The entire exam consists of two parts, where the first covers (i) cosmology and (ii) extragalactic astronomy, and the second covers (iii) galactic astronomy, (iv) stellar astrophysics, and (v) physics. For each of these five sections, three questions are chosen at random. Each question allows two minutes for providing an answer and five minutes for follow-up questions; timing is strictly enforced. The following documents include the 2018 question bank in addition to my own personal solutions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or corrections to these. </p>

						<h2>Thesis Qualifying Exam</h2>
						<p>galactic magnetism ; interstellar medium ; polarization ; turbulence</p>
					</header>
					<p> In additional to the General Qualifying Exam, there is also a Thesis Qualifying Exam that generally takes place the same summer. This is an oral examination to a panel of faculty members (i.e., the Thesis Committee) which consists of a 20-25 minute presentation followed by a 90-150 minute questioning period. A strong emphasis is placed on the ability to defend the scientific motivation and feasibility of the proposed thesis, as well as having a general mastery of closely related topics deemed necessary for the thesis work. A 10-20 page document describing the proposed thesis, including the scientific motivation, techniques, feasibility, and timeline must also be sent a few days prior to the exam. The following is a rough outline that I followed for my Thesis Proposal: </p>

					<p style="margin-left: 40px">
						<strong>1. Abstract</strong><br>
						<strong>2. Introduction</strong><br>
						Explain the necessary background information to set the context of your proposed thesis work. Begin with a broad description of the field and provide a review of what's already known about the aspects directly relevant to your thesis. While narrowing down on the specifics of your thesis topic(s), describe the nature of any outstanding issues and how your research will contribute to solving them.<br>
						<strong>3. Thesis Statement</strong><br>
						State your proposed thesis in a couple of sentences. Explain what you aim to show with your work and what you might expect to see. Consider possible outcomes and make sure they're both interesting and publishable whether you get the expected result or not.<br>
						<strong>4. Approach and Proposed Thesis Structure</strong><br>
						A detailed description of how you plan to follow through with your thesis work, including calculations, techniques, data, assumptions, limitations, range of validity, etc. Visualize your publications! Outline each paper you plan on publishing and their ultimate goal (e.g., a specific plot).<br>
						<strong>5. Timeline</strong><br>
						A detailed timeline of the thesis work in a table format working in monthly increments. Anticipate potential problems and setbacks, and make sure to dedicate time to applying for jobs.<br>
						<strong>6. Bibliography</strong>
					</p>

					<p>The primary pieces of feedback that I received from a preliminary draft of my proposal were: (i) include some theoretical context in the introduction since my thesis work is largely observational, (ii) be more specific as to how the data will be interpreted for each project/paper, and (iii) if specific relationships do not hold in the data as we may suspect, consider how this might affect the thesis structure and timeline. </p>
