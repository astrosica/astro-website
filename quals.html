						<h2>General Qualifying Exam</h2>
						<p>cosmology ; extragalactic astronomy ; galactic astronomy ; stellar astrophysics ; physics </p>
					</header>
					<p> The General Qualifying Exam is an oral examination to a panel of faculty members typically taking place in the summer of second year. The entire exam consists of two parts, where the first covers (i) cosmology and (ii) extragalactic astronomy, and the second covers (iii) galactic astronomy, (iv) stellar astrophysics, and (v) physics. For each of these five sections, three questions are chosen at random. Each question allows two minutes for providing an answer and five minutes for follow-up questions; timing is strictly enforced. The following documents include the 2018 question bank in addition to my own personal solutions. I have done my best at providing a "short answer" for a very simple understanding of the problem, in addition to some extra reading under "additional context" for more information with every question. At the end of each section, I have outlined the resources I used (although I did not explicitly reference these throughout my solutions). I have also included an Appendix section for commonly used acronyms, mathematical variables, useful values, equations, and some general notes I made to myself along the way. Here I have also done my best to specify dimensions/units where applicable. These solutions by no means are meant to be the final answer to any of these questions; rather, they are my attempt at the necessary research and trying to piece together a reasonable solution.</p>

						<h2>Thesis Qualifying Exam</h2>
						<p>galactic magnetism ; interstellar medium ; polarization ; turbulence</p>
					</header>
					<p> In additional to the General Qualifying Exam, there is also a Thesis Qualifying Exam that generally takes place the same summer. This is an oral examination to a panel of faculty members (i.e., the Thesis Committee) which consists of a 20-25 minute presentation followed by a 90-150 minute questioning period. A strong emphasis is placed on the ability to defend the scientific motivation and feasibility of the proposed thesis, as well as having a general mastery of closely related topics deemed necessary for the thesis work. A 10-20 page document describing the proposed thesis, including the scientific motivation, techniques, feasibility, and timeline must also be sent to the Committee at least four days prior to the exam. The following is a rough outline that I followed for my Thesis Proposal: </p>

					<p style="margin-left: 40px">
						<strong>1. Abstract</strong><br>
						<strong>2. Introduction</strong><br>
						Explain the necessary background information to set the context of your proposed thesis work. Begin with a broad description of the field and provide a review of what's already known about the aspects directly relevant to your thesis. While narrowing down on the specifics of your thesis topic(s), describe the nature of any outstanding issues and how your research will contribute to solving them.<br>
						<strong>3. Thesis Statement</strong><br>
						State your proposed thesis in a couple of sentences. Explain what you aim to show with your work and what you might expect to see. Consider possible outcomes and make sure they're both interesting and publishable whether you get the expected result or not.<br>
						<strong>4. Approach and Proposed Thesis Structure</strong><br>
						A detailed description of how you plan to follow through with your thesis work, including calculations, techniques, data, assumptions, limitations, range of validity, etc. Visualize your publications! Outline each paper you plan on publishing and their ultimate goal (e.g., a specific plot).<br>
						<strong>5. Timeline</strong><br>
						A detailed timeline of the thesis work in a table format working in monthly increments. Anticipate potential problems and setbacks, and make sure to dedicate time to applying for jobs.<br>
						<strong>6. Bibliography</strong>
